## Codebase Patterns
- Use `npx tsc --noEmit` for typecheck
- Monorepo uses npm workspaces
- At least one .ts file must exist for typecheck to pass

- Created base monorepo directory structure
- Files created:
  - packages/relay-api/package.json (stub)
  - packages/mirror-worker/README.md (placeholder)
  - packages/viewer-web/README.md (placeholder)
  - packages/adapters/.gitkeep
  - packages/shared/schema/.gitkeep
  - packages/shared/types/.gitkeep
  - packages/shared/utils/.gitkeep
  - packages/shared/index.ts (entry point)
  - package.json (root with workspaces)
  - tsconfig.json (root config)
  - .gitignore
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeScript requires at least one .ts file to pass typecheck
  - Added packages/shared/index.ts as placeholder

- Created infra and docs directories
- Files created:
  - infra/migrations/.gitkeep
  - docs/prd/milestone-h0.md (placeholder)
  - docs/crp/crp-v0.1.md (placeholder)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Simple directory scaffolding doesn't require additional patterns

- Created shared package with Zod event schema
- Files created/modified:
  - packages/shared/package.json (with zod dependency)
  - packages/shared/schema/event.ts (EventSchema, SourceSchema, and inferred types)
  - packages/shared/index.ts (exports schema and types)
- Removed packages/shared/schema/.gitkeep (no longer needed)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use z.string().uuid() for UUID validation
  - Use z.string().datetime() for ISO-8601 timestamp validation
  - Use z.object({}).passthrough() for flexible objects that allow additional fields
  - Sample event validation can be tested with node directly using require('zod')

- Created database migration for feeds table
- Files created:
  - infra/migrations/001_create_feeds.sql
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS for idempotent migrations
  - gen_random_uuid() is the Postgres function for default UUID generation
  - JSONB is the preferred type for JSON columns in Postgres

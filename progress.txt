## Codebase Patterns
- Use `npx tsc --noEmit` for typecheck
- Monorepo uses npm workspaces
- At least one .ts file must exist for typecheck to pass
- Use `condition: service_completed_successfully` for one-shot migration containers in docker-compose
- Shared package must be built before relay-api can run (`npm run build` in shared)
- Use vitest for testing in relay-api (`npm run test`)
- Integration tests run against live server at http://localhost:3000

- Implemented SSE broadcast for ingested events
- Files modified:
  - packages/relay-api/src/index.ts (imported pubsub, added subscribe/unsubscribe to SSE endpoint, publish on event insert)
- SSE endpoint now subscribes to pub/sub for the feed_id and writes events as `data: {...}\n\n`
- POST /events publishes to pub/sub after successful insert (201 only, not duplicates)
- Client disconnect triggers unsubscribe to clean up listeners
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Only publish to pub/sub for new events (201), not duplicates (200)
  - SSE messages use `data: ` prefix followed by JSON and double newline
  - Subscribe callback must be stored as variable for proper unsubscribe on disconnect

- Events ordered ascending by (ts, id)
- Response returns array of event objects with reconstructed source nested object
- **Learnings for future iterations:**

  - infra/docker-compose.yml (exposed postgres port 5432 for local development)
- Test validates complete flow: create feed → connect SSE → POST event → receive via SSE → verify persistence
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Shared package requires TypeScript compilation before relay-api can run
  - Use `.js` extension in TypeScript imports when using ESM module resolution
  - Vitest works well for ESM-based TypeScript projects
  - Integration tests should run against live server (requires docker compose up or local run)
  - Use http module directly for SSE client in tests (simpler than EventSource for server-side)

  - packages/mirror-worker/src/repo.ts
- initRepo() creates repo directory if it doesn't exist
- Runs git init if .git folder doesn't exist
- Creates CRP directory structure: events/, snapshots/, policy/, .crp/
- Creates .crp/manifest.json with version "0.1" and created_at timestamp
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern similar to scripts/crp_init.ts but as a reusable function
  - Use fs.existsSync() to check before creating for idempotency
  - execSync with stdio: "inherit" shows git output to user

- Implemented writeEvent(repoPath, event) function in src/repo.ts
- Files modified:
  - packages/mirror-worker/src/repo.ts (added writeEvent function with Event import)
- Extracts date from event.ts (ISO-8601) using substring(0, 10) for YYYY-MM-DD
- Creates directory structure events/{feed_id}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/ with recursive mkdir
- Writes event JSON with 2-space indentation
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Import Event type from @switchboard/shared for type safety
  - Use event.ts.substring(0, 10) to extract YYYY-MM-DD from ISO-8601 timestamp

- Created Committer class in src/committer.ts
- Files created:
  - packages/mirror-worker/src/committer.ts
- Committer constructor accepts repoPath, batchSize, and timeoutMs
- addEvent() queues event and triggers commit if batch size reached, otherwise schedules timeout
- Timeout schedules commit after timeoutMs if pending events exist
- commit() runs git add -A then git commit with "Mirror: add {n} event(s)" message
- flush() method added for graceful shutdown (commits any pending events)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use NodeJS.Timeout type for timeout handle
  - Clear timeout before committing to prevent duplicate commits
  - flush() method useful for graceful shutdown scenarios

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba99a-abc3-778c-9847-a8a941312926
- Wired up main entry point in src/index.ts
- Files modified:
  - packages/mirror-worker/src/index.ts (implemented main function)
- Reads config via getConfig()
- Calls initRepo() to ensure repo is initialized
- Creates Committer instance with config batch settings
- Connects to SSE for each feed in FEED_IDS
- On event received, calls writeEvent() then committer.addEvent()
- Logs startup message with relay URL and feed count
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use .js extension in ESM imports even for TypeScript files
  - Cast FeedEvent to Event type since they share same structure

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba99b-a2e5-75e8-9387-e042cc074f5b
- Implemented graceful shutdown for mirror-worker
- Files modified:
  - packages/mirror-worker/src/sse.ts (added SSEConnection interface with close() method)
  - packages/mirror-worker/src/index.ts (added SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers, shutdown function)
- SSE connections now return SSEConnection object with close() that stops reconnection and closes EventSource
- Shutdown function: closes all SSE connections, calls committer.flush(), logs shutdown message, exits with code 0
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use a `closed` flag to prevent reconnection attempts after shutdown
  - Clear pending reconnect timeouts when closing SSE connections
  - Signal handlers can use synchronous functions when operations are synchronous (flush uses execSync)

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba99d-43cf-77bc-b810-c2bf397d1163
- Created integration test for mirror worker flow
- Files created:
  - packages/mirror-worker/src/__tests__/integration.test.ts
- Files modified:
  - packages/mirror-worker/package.json (added vitest, @switchboard/shared, test scripts)
- Test workflow:
  1. Creates temp directory for CONTEXT_REPO_PATH
  2. Creates feed via POST /feeds
  3. Initializes git repo with user config in temp dir
  4. Starts mirror process with configured environment
  5. Posts 3 events to relay API
  6. Verifies 3 event files exist in correct CRP paths (events/{feed_id}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{event_id}.json)
  7. Verifies git log contains "Mirror:" commit message
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Integration tests require live relay API server (docker compose up)
  - Temp directories need git user config (user.email, user.name) before commits work
  - Use fs.mkdtempSync with os.tmpdir() for temp directories
  - Mirror process spawned with spawn(), not execSync, to run in background during test

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba9b7-0784-73c9-a189-fa774a9dea0c
- Added GitHub configuration env vars to mirror-worker
- Files modified:
  - packages/mirror-worker/src/config.ts (added GitHubConfig interface, GITHUB_PAT/GITHUB_REPO_URL/GITHUB_BRANCH parsing, redactPat function)
  - packages/mirror-worker/src/index.ts (added GitHub mode logging at startup with redacted PAT)
- GitHub config is optional - if GITHUB_PAT or GITHUB_REPO_URL not set, runs in local-only mode
- GITHUB_BRANCH defaults to "main" if not specified
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - GitHubConfig is a separate interface for clean optional typing
  - redactPat() shows first 4 chars + *** for security

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba9b9-0dd9-775a-8457-8dc9f5666c8f
- Created src/git.ts with configureRemote(repoPath, repoUrl, pat) function
- Checks for existing origin using git remote get-url origin
- Adds remote if not exists, updates if URL differs
- Uses URL class to embed PAT: https://{PAT}@github.com/owner/repo.git
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use new URL() to parse and modify repository URLs safely
  - execSync with stdio: ["pipe", "pipe", "pipe"] captures errors without logging to console
  - Check for null after try/catch to distinguish between missing remote and existing one

- Implemented fetchAndRebase(repoPath, branch) function in src/git.ts
- Runs git fetch origin {branch} first
- Runs git rebase origin/{branch} to rebase local commits
- Returns true if successful, false if rebase fails
- If rebase fails, runs git rebase --abort and logs error
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use stdio: ["pipe", "pipe", "pipe"] to suppress git output and capture errors
  - Always abort failed rebase to clean up git state

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba9bb-240b-77d8-8452-ebc0880eb309
- Implemented checkAppendOnly(repoPath, branch) function in src/git.ts
- Runs git diff --name-status origin/{branch}..HEAD
- Parses output lines for files in events/ directory
- Returns true if all event file changes are A (added)
- Returns false and logs error if any M (modified) or D (deleted) found
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - git diff --name-status returns tab-separated "STATUS\tFILENAME" format
  - Use line.split("\t") to parse status and filepath

- Implemented pushToRemote(repoPath, branch) function in src/git.ts
- Files modified:
  - packages/mirror-worker/src/git.ts (added pushToRemote function)
- Runs git push origin {branch} with suppressed output
- Returns true on success, logs "Pushed to GitHub"
- Returns false on failure, logs error but does not throw
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Consistent pattern with other git functions: use stdio: ["pipe", "pipe", "pipe"] to capture errors
  - Log success message exactly as specified in acceptance criteria

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba9bd-8701-74d8-afa9-abfdc9dd889b
- Integrated GitHub push into Committer class
- Files modified:
  - packages/mirror-worker/src/committer.ts (added githubConfig constructor param, pushToGitHub method)
- Committer constructor now accepts optional GitHubConfig
- After each commit, if githubConfig is provided, calls checkAppendOnly, fetchAndRebase, pushToRemote
- All failures are logged and gracefully handled (no crash, retry on next batch)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Import GitHubConfig from config.js and git functions from git.js
  - Push is triggered after commit(), not before
  - Each step (checkAppendOnly, fetchAndRebase, pushToRemote) returns early on failure

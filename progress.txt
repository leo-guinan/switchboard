## Codebase Patterns
- Use `npx tsc --noEmit` for typecheck
- Monorepo uses npm workspaces
- At least one .ts file must exist for typecheck to pass

- Created base monorepo directory structure
- Files created:
  - packages/relay-api/package.json (stub)
  - packages/mirror-worker/README.md (placeholder)
  - packages/viewer-web/README.md (placeholder)
  - packages/adapters/.gitkeep
  - packages/shared/schema/.gitkeep
  - packages/shared/types/.gitkeep
  - packages/shared/utils/.gitkeep
  - packages/shared/index.ts (entry point)
  - package.json (root with workspaces)
  - tsconfig.json (root config)
  - .gitignore
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeScript requires at least one .ts file to pass typecheck
  - Added packages/shared/index.ts as placeholder
